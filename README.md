### Project Information
This program randomly generates memes by randomly selecting one quote out of eight quotes and one image out of eight image to create a unique meme. The user is greeted with a unique meme the moment the application starts. The eight quotes and eight images are saved in values/strings.xml that are displayed upon clicks of the buttons on the screen. Buttons displayed include “Next” and “Clear,” which are responsible for generating the next meme and clearing the meme count. Upon clicking the two buttons, a “Toast” message will pop out, saying “since launch we showed you X memes,” and “your meme counter is cleared.” All messages displayed are translated to French upon switching system languages to French, through creating a separate directory values-fr/strings.xml. 

Features: 
Five buttons — each button (red, blue, default/white, gray, and black) is used to change the screen to its designated color. Upon clicking each button, the screen changes to the color selected, while a “Toast” message pops us saying “Background changed to [color] 🎉.” This feature includes localizing user interface languages to French as well. Thus, all strings used in this program are available in French upon system setting language changes.
